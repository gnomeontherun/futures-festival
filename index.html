          <h2 class="header-2">2020 continues to change our lives in dramatic ways. Globally.</h2>
          
          <p>Over the course of the last two years, we are proud that Futures Festival has become a free public knowledge sharing event centered on Futures Thinking. In our efforts to finalize the 2020 theme, it dawned on us, that we don’t want to jump themes every year. In fact, we want to stay committed to the same one that has been at the core of our event from its inception: that of Inclusivity and Plurality, and have each year, instead, look at different aspects and angles. This remains a feeling of critical importance with each passing year.</p>

          <p>We all know that 2020 is continuing to change our lives in dramatic ways. Globally. To use our theme last year - ‘radical transformations’ are unfolding in front of us. There is an aftermath of confusion, pain, and loss, but also that of new opportunities and possibilities.</p>

          <p>Because after Collapse comes Transformation, this year we open space for dissent; we put emphasis on the spectrum of views, and voices needed to collectively create our alternative futures. Our festival focus this year, Full Spectrum Futures, is about radical unity.</p>

          <!-- <p>To use our theme from last year as inspiration, 'radical transformations' are unfolding in front of us. There is an aftermath of grief, pain, and loss, but also that of new possibilities.</p>
          <p>Our festival theme this year, Full Spectrum Futures, will amplify practitioner's and projects who are driving change in partnership with the community. Who, in the chaos, are seeing windows where there are walls. Who are asking new types of questions. Whose projects are welcoming new voices into the conversation, and the action.</p> -->

            <p>We want to commit to consistently showcasing practitioners from around the world who are united by their commitment to inclusivity and plurality in imagining the future. We want to go on this annual journey with you, and see how this conversation continues to evolve until it becomes our collective norm.</p>

            <p>In the past two years, we have hosted over 50 speakers, and almost 50 sessions committed to this cause, and welcomed over 900 registrants from over 45 countries.</p>
              
            <p>This year, we want to amplify practitioner’s and projects who are driving change with a particularly strong partnership with the community. Who in the chaos, are seeing windows where there were walls. Who are asking new types of questions, and seeking new types of answers. Whose projects are welcoming new voices to act on the redefining moments of 2020.</p>
