      <h1 class="header-1 center">About Futures Festival</h1>
      <p>Futures Festival is a purely volunteer run annual knowledge sharing event. The 2020 team is made up of returning and new global volunteers living in Canada, Germany Portugal, Thailand, Mexico and the US. All united in valuing the festival’s principles of inclusion, plurality, and collective participation as a means to how we can move towards challenging the status quo and move towards preferable shared futures.</p>
      <p>We are committed to creating an event that showcases global and diverse examples of inter-disciplinary, multi-disciplinary practitioners and organizations who are putting these principles to practice. In that sense, as a team we have chosen to prioritize applied examples over speculative work. We would love to know you more so please do reach out - you can find our contact info on our bio pages!</p>
