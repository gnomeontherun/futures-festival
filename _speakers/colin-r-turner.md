I'm an Irish musician and author who advocates for an open access economy - a proposed methodology that ensures (at a minimum) that every person's needs are met without condition through a voluntary cooperative system, while maximizing preservation of living systems. I have authored two books on the topic F-Day and Into The Open Economy, and am founder of The Free World Charter (a charter for a post-money social contract), Sharebay (a library of free goods and services), HonorPay (an open awards network) and an extensive wiki detailing the concept of an Open Access Economy. I have given many talks on the topic including an appearance at TEDx in Galway, Ireland, and at Z-Day in Frankfurt.
