As a first-generation Haitian-American who has lived in Latin America, the UAE, China, and Southeast Asia, Sophia was moved to contribute to Black Futures research around experiences and perceptions of “blackness” in a global context.

She is an independent foresight researcher and founder of FLYP (Futures Literate Youth and Professionals), a boutique coaching and consulting agency focused on “flipping the script” by promoting futures literacy and foresight capacities among systemically under-represented and marginalized groups. With a deep background in education, her work as a Purpose and Impact Coach is largely centered around advocating for and galvanizing a more conscious and conscientious youth.
