  <h1 class="header-1 center">About Futures Festival</h1>
  <p>Futures Festival is a purely volunteer run annual knowledge sharing event, hosted by <a href="https://apf.org">APF (Association of Professional Futurists)</a>. The 2021 team is made up of returning and new global volunteers. All united in valuing the festival’s principles of inclusion, plurality, and collective participation as a means to how we can move towards challenging the status quo and move towards preferable shared futures.</p>
  <p>We are committed to creating an event that showcases global and diverse examples of inter-disciplinary, multi-disciplinary practitioners and organizations who are putting these principles to practice. In that sense, as a team we have chosen to prioritize applied examples over speculative work. We would love to know you more so please do reach out - you can find our contact info on our bio pages!</p>
