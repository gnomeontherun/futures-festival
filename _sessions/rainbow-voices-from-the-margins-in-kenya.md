  bio: 'I am a youth educator whose focus is to help young people find psychosocial
    and economic empowerment, particularly the young people living on social-economic
    margins. In doing this, I become an agent of hope, meaning, and purpose in life.
    I am the founding director of Break Margins Africa, a community-based organisation
    that offers economic empowerment to disadvantaged young people who hail from slums
    of Nairobi, through scholarships to pursue professional and technical training
    so that they can compete favorably in the local job market and/or establish their
    own businesses. My academic background is in Youth Studies, where I have a BA
    Youth Ministry from Tangaza University College. '

  bio: I am a Nairobi-based consultant working with strategic foresight, research,
    evaluation, and capacity building across a range of sectors globally. Projects
    have included access to justice, futures capacity building with local LGBTI groups,
    youth empowerment, training university students with futures thinking, systems
    mapping of food security policy reform, evaluating leadership development and
    global freedom of religion/belief programmes. My PhD was in African Studies, where
    I explored religious pedagogies of political socialisation in Kenya. My dream
    is to see more groups across Africa equipped with futures thinking and increased
    agency to build their own preferred futures.
