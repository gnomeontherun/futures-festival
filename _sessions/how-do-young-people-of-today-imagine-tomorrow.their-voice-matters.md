  bio: 'Master''s degree in Psychology. Senior trends Researcher & Analyst for leading
    companies in Spain and Latin America. Currently I combine my work as Network Weaver
    with Teach the Future’s global Community with my work as part of Mindset, a boutique
    consultancy specialized in designing innovative learning experiences. I am also
    a member of the Speculative Futures Chapter team in Madrid where we organized
    events about speculative futures design from diverse points of views. Since 2012,
    I combine my professional activity with teaching and research work as professor
    of Research and Trends Analysis and Systems Thinking. I was always passionate
    about knowing what is the next big thing, I am constantly learning about new social,
    cultural, philosophical and artistic movements, but above all, I am interested
    in people, their study and analysis as a social being, capable of the best, but
    also of the worst. My wish, perhaps utopian, is that the light gradually overcome
    the darkness, that we become more aware of our weaknesses as a species, and that
    we actively work both individually and as a group, to build better futures together. '

  bio: 'Desired future: My desired future is that children can access to education.
    I hope they can have water; a house and they can grow up in peace with their families.
    That children can think about their future and build it. I hope children can grow
    up happy, protected by their communities, regardless of their ethnicity, religion
    or socioeconomic status. Threatening future: My most feared future is one where
    people do not seek to do something to change. A scenario where violence, selfishness
    and greed continue to deteriorate the environment, and this leads to diseases.
    I am concerned that the children suffer from lack of water, shelter and food.
    I feel sad if children cannot plan their own future and strive to achieve it.
    Anything that you would like to add: My dream is that people work together for
    a better future for all. I believe that if we educate children and young people
    today, they will have elements to change current trends tomorrow.'

    I'm really interested in economics and anything related to social injustice or political science!
