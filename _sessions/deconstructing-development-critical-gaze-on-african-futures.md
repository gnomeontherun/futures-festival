This talk would be led by three International Development Professionals from the African diaspora who are currently based in Toronto: Asia Clarke, Christina Muia and Ikem Opara. We are graduate students of OCAD University’s Strategic Foresight and Innovation program who bring a diversity of professional and lived experiences in social and economic development spanning from non-profits, foundations and the United Nations. This talk will provide a critical look at deconstructing dominant narratives in development, allowing for ‘beneficiary’ narratives to be challenged and for decolonization to begin happening. 

This talk seeks to uncover how current changes in geo-political relationships between continental African countries, Africans in the diaspora and the West are impacting the lives of everyday Africans. By drawing from our respective research fields, we look at the macro- and micro-economic policies which have led to the uneven development of African countries. We believe that the voices of African citizens, particularly African youth are crucial in framing future approaches to development in the continent. We will explore our experiences in the aforementioned topics, and ultimately present examples of development initiatives on the horizon that we feel are promising, inclusive, ethical, and sustainable.
