As the world grapples with the unprecedented circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 global pandemic, it also presents an opportune time to actively address the human-side of what’s been brewing beneath the surface of our very existence - the impact and dire consequences of the lack of inclusion, equity, and accessibility in all facets of our lives.  
  
When we look at the tech industry, we see its obsession to blindly continue down the rabbit hole of the rush to create the next best killer app in VR and AR. Oftentimes, dismissing the bigger picture that Extended Reality is a human journey and it brings along the human-centered challenges.  
  
The same biases displayed in the headlines covering the George Floyd and Breonna Taylor cases are in fact the same biases that go into data sets and moderation tools that put people of color and historically marginalized populations at risk in immersive environments as well.  
  
In this panel, the CyberXR Coalition discusses their unique approach to helping build safe and inclusive environments in XR and Cybersecurity, while shifting the mindsets to create awareness of these very issues and draw a baseline via standards and frameworks to potentially provide solutions coupled with strategic collaboration.
