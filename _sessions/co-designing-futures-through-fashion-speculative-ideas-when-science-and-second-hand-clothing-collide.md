This proposal attends to the possibility of reuniting design practices and foresight to facilitate futures imagination through co-designing and prototyping. This workshop intends to approach speculative design and co-design as methods that democratise and facilitate futures thinking. 

Speculative design opens space for critical debates about new technology and its impacts in society, while increasingly immersive practices emphasise the value of experiencing possible futures, today. 

New technologies have been developed in an increasing pace. Science practitioners seek to explore scientific discoveries with non-expert audiences in more engaging and meaningful ways. Design speculation and fashion can act as a bridge to connect people to science, exploring technological impacts in societies in more engaging forms. 

This workshop explores potential futures of specific science technologies through fashion as material culture. We will explore a scenario where resource shortages force the fashion industry to adopt a circular model, leading to fusions between second-hand garments and new technologies that end up addressing or subverting societal needs. 

Attendees will explore the fusion methods and approaches to collaboratively learn how alternative mediums present in everyday life such as fashion can work as a bridge to science and futures.
