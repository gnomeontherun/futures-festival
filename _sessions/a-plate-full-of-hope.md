The presentation will be about how I used the covid-19 crisis to create a movement called ‘A Plate Full of Hope’ that used art to provide meals and hope to millions across India. It brought together artists, charities, good samaritans and art-loves from all over the world. In total 150,000 meals were provided to the needy in just the span of one month [https://www.theplatedproject.com/](https://www.theplatedproject.com/ "https://www.theplatedproject.com/"). When covid-19 struck India, 140 million people lost their jobs, out of these over 100 million were migrant workers and daily wage earners. 

As a founder of an innovation collective, I wanted to use my skills to help these migrant workers. I reached out to 20 global artists and created art with them that showcased hope during the crisis. I used these to create limited edition art-plates. 100% of the sales’ proceeds were donated to charity and each plate sold = 250 meals provided. We sold out the entire collection in 25 days! In less than a month, we had over 40 global publications talk about this initiative. I launched a commerce store on zero budgets using wix, marketed this on Instagram with no spends and did many more things which can inspire all of us to make a difference. At the end, I want to inspire people to think that one person and a small action can make a big difference.
