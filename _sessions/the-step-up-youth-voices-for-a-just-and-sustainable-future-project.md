The Step Up-Youth Voices for a Just & Sustainable Future project connects and builds of our experience as a convener of diverse youth groups and a partner of key national and global coalitions , we believe that the time is right to raise up the voices of youth groups at the front-lines to support a transformational shift that ensures gender justice and equality, enabling everyone to live their lives in dignity, free from hunger and from the fear of violence, oppression, discrimination or injustice, in a way that protects the planetary systems required to sustain all life on earth.

Youth are ready to step up and take action directly, there are growing numbers of dynamic approaches to local sustainability, built from the ground up by youth communities and embedded in traditional knowledge and ethical practices. Therefore, we are in a strong position to share the stories of our members and partners to ensure that local youth community voices of those who are directly challenging governments and holding them to account for their lack of action on key targets for climate, rights and sustainable development can be heard.
