  bio: "Sowmya Lakshminarayanan is a cell biologist turned ed-preneur. Sowmya's passion
    for social change started as early as in college days where she witnessed how
    gender and economic status of an individual decided the further path in STEM field.
    She has set out to address this gap by starting a not for profit organisation
    called Lead by Design foundation in 2019. At LBD, we  envision that every child
    has creative potential that will make the world a better place for all. \n\nLBD
    is a not for profit organisation which aims to build active citizenship amongst
    young students through social innovation. "

The presentation will focus on what happens when children lead us with courage and compassion towards a just and equitable world. What can we as adults learn from children (and we believe there are many, curiosity and kindness for example).  
  
1\. Children and their creative potential - How creating inclusive and safe spaces alone unleashes the creative potential of children.   
2\. The proof is in the pudding - How have children gone ahead to build local contextual solutions for global challenges.   
3\. How digital media can actually bridge the social gap. 

We created a common platform (through zoom) for children from different strata of the society to come together and co-create solutions. These spaces created steep learning for both the types of children. For children from marginalised communities, it gave an opportunity to learn new technology and tools from their counterpart, to be articulative; For children from the other part of the society, it gave an opportunity to be vulnerable, to be open and accepting of one's shortcomings.
