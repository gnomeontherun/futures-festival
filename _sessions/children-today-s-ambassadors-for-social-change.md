  bio: "Anna Maria Geogy is an architect turned educator who is currently exploring
    curriculum design that can enable children to think and build 21st century skills.
    \n\nGrowing up, The United World Project by the Y4UW International influenced
    her to engage in social projects to increase youth participation in local communities.\n\nAs
    a Teach For India fellow, she explored co-creating a holistic education space
    with her classroom of 10 year olds. This experience strengthened her belief that
    creating ‘with’ children rather than for them empowers both child and educator.\n\nLateral
    thinking, human centered design, sustainable living and alternate economy are
    some of her areas of interest. "

The presentation will focus on what happens when children lead us with courage and compassion towards a just and equitable world. What can we as adults learn from children (and we believe there are many, curiosity and kindness for example).

1\. Children and their creative potential - How creating inclusive and safe spaces alone unleashes the creative potential of children.  
2\. The proof is in the pudding - How have children gone ahead to build local contextual solutions for global challenges.  
3\. How digital media can actually bridge the social gap.

We created a common platform (through zoom) for children from different strata of the society to come together and co-create solutions. These spaces created steep learning for both the types of children. For children from marginalised communities, it gave an opportunity to learn new technology and tools from their counterpart, to be articulative; For children from the other part of the society, it gave an opportunity to be vulnerable, to be open and accepting of one's shortcomings.
