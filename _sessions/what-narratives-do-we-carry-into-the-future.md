Calling all people who dream of better futures.

  
What narratives do we carry into the future? How do our unintended biases and lived experiences shape the futures we may create? 

  
Using a guided walk in the park activity, this workshop instructs participants to imagine a day in their ideal future. Through group discussion, the participants will examine the inherent biases that exist in their ideal futures and how these are shaped by their experiences and understandings of the present. This workshop encourages radical unity through heightened awareness and self-reflection.
