This experiential workshop will immerse you in a fictional future set in the year 2032 when an Indigenous Latinx Woman is running for President of the United States. As a global citizen in the year 2032, you'll be attending a Wide Awakes community meeting. We’ll start by acknowledging the events of the past that brought us to this point, reflecting on the present (i.e. 2032), and casting a vision for the future. Then you & fellow community members will co-create ideas for the next play in the infinite game. 

This workshop is an adaptation of the Wide Awakes Futures Lab sessions that were part of social media theater experience, Resilience 2032. The story of the 2032 election originally unfolded in real-time over the course of one month from September 12th through October 12th through Instagram content, weekly immersive experiences on Zoom, and a weekly live-stream talk-show, all set in one possible future. They are currently accepting submissions of future artifacts to be included in the archival content for the project through their[ creator call](https://www.resilience2032.com/creatorcall) and [film competition](https://www.resilience2032.com/filmcompetition).
