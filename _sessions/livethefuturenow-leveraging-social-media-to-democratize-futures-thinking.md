Takeaways and highlights from a month of living in the year 2032 from September 12th - October 12th. This tremendous experiment (currently still in progress) is an innovative way to get a new generation thinking creatively about the future. We will share what we learned and a vision for how this format can become a medium to share futures thinking with a new audience. See www.Resilience2032.com for more.
