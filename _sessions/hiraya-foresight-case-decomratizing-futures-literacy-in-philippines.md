title: Hiraya Foresight - The Case of Democratizing Futures Literacy in the Philippines
type: Keynote

---
How might Filipino futurists and practitioners decolonize and democratize futures literacy knowledge and access in the Philippines? What does a socio-aspirational approach to futures literacy look like?  What is the Hiraya Foresight approach? What makes it socio-aspirational? How might we make futures literacy and praxis culturally engaging, authentic, empowering, accessible, radical, meaningful, and impactful?  This presentation aims to share the Philippine Futures Thinking Society's full-spectrum case and story of igniting the Filipino Hiraya (the fruit of one's aspirations, hopes, and dreams) through the power of foresight.

In this presentation, participants will learn:

1. PhilFutures socio-aspirational and praxis-driven futures literacy approach at the systems (high-level policy foresight engagements),  learning, education and research (academic, professionals, civic), and community advocacy (youth, health, environment, cultural).
2. Case study on how six committed and passionate individuals can mobilize and organize a community-based, country-wide, and global-wide full-spectrum futures literacy programs and events.
3. The case of reflecting and acting to diversify and making futures literacy education and engagements more inclusive.
