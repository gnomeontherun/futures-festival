Champions of Hope is an ongoing project, whereby the organisation I run, has worked with young adolescent girls from rural communities in Bihar, one of India's most backward states, and in a region that has amongst the lowest literacy rates, is flood prone every year and falls behind on almost every development index. The Youth Leadership Development Program witnesses the young girls undergo immense personal and professional transformation. Over the course of 3 years of the program the girls are trained and also get to engage with community (primary school children, parents)  at multiple levels. 

Empowering these girls have enabled us to make them community champions during the COVID times as well. 

The 3 main ideas that the talk will focus on are 

a. Adopting Systems Thinking to create impactful interventions in rural communities
b. The creation of Change-makers in a highly conservative society
c. Fighting the odds to empower young girls as Community Champions.
