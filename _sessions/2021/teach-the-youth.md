  bio: 'Hi I am Lisa Giuliani one of the Directors of Global Projects with Teach the Future. Beginning in April of 2021 my team and I were selected to partner with the School of International Futures to create an award for youth titled Next Generation of Foresight Practitioners - Young Voices (NGFP - YV).  We found that there was a need to recognize and celebrate the next generation of changemakers who are taking action and leading the way to create a more sustainable world.'

There are many young people around the world showing tremendous insight into the world around them, and the challenges faced by their communities. We found the need to recognize and celebrate the next generation of changemakers who are taking action and leading the way to change and create a more sustainable world. As you know, Teach the Future organized a panel of young voices last year expressing their desires for a better future. This is our continued intention to promote futures thinking including the voices and ideas of the younger generations.The NGFP - YV allowed young voices to be at the forefront of changemaking during unprecedented times of change, uncertainty, and disruption. Problems like poverty and climate change require a common understanding of foresight and taking action as a collective society. The NGFP - YV awards highlighted young voices that are willing to push past the perceptions of society to solve the problems of tomorrow. By understanding other perspectives and launching youth-led solutions, we are pushing for a more collective future rather than a singular future. We are “Shifting from Me to We” by including our youth voices who are working on projects in different parts of the world to better the communities we all live in.
