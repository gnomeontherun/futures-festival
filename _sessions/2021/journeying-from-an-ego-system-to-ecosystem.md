Before the pandemic, Bangladesh succeeded in providing access to education to nearly 100% of our children during their primary years, however challenges in education quality remained not just in our country, but around the world as well. This is to extent that schooling without learning has been called out as an act of injustice. On one hand, Covid-19 managed to further exacerbate and reveal the inequities that exist within the education system and society, but on the other, it has compelled governments and civil society to undertake pockets of action to experiment and leapfrog to diverse forms of education modalities – high-tech, low-tech and no-tech. These pockets of action have nurtured the discourse that learning takes place not just in school, but potentially anywhere, establishing the foundation for a blended learning ecosystem that continues to grow even after schools function normally. However, the nurturing of futures-oriented educational discourse and action does not necessarily happen automatically or through disparate individual acts, but it requires an environment of collaboration and authentic trust. This session will discuss how collaboration and trust can be nurtured in an ecosystem with such diverse actors to work towards an education system that works for all, not just some.
