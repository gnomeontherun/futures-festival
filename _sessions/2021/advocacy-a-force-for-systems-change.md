This presentation will explore advocacy and its role in achieving systems change through influencing decision-making and changing public opinion now and in the future. Findings from a recent survey of 175  U.S.-based nonprofits will provide a detailed look at the types of advocacy advocates undertake and how they have adapted under the twin 'pandemics' of Covid-19 and racial injustice.  The findings will be framed by four types of purposive change that speak to the 'reach' of advocates, ranging from mobilizing citizens to influencing policymaker support. Five case studies of different advocacy and/or policy-making initiatives will be used to highlight different advocacy strategies and the changes achieve. Participants will have an opportunity to discuss what the current understanding of advocates and their advocacy portend for the future of advocacy.
