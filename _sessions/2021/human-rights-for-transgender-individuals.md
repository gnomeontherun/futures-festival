Within the trans community, I consider myself as privileged, because I can do my work as scientist without much discrimination. However, I recognize that the majority of trans* individuals in my country do not have such privilege and, instead, they face continuous discrimination. Therefore, it is my job to go "from me to we" and for that reason I dedicate my time as activist to empower the trans* cummunity, and fight for the human rights of all trans* individuals. One particular example is the recognition of the need of basic human right for those dedicated to sex work. Hence, even from a position of privilege, I understand that we need to fight for the needs of trans* brothers and sisters in need.
