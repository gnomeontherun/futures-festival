“If we can help a few, the ripple effect can spread endlessly.” -- Chaun Pridgeon, Play for Peace trainer

Never before has the plea for peace been so real and so necessary. All too often, children and youth suffer the most. This is where Play for Peace comes in. We teach and support young leaders to be peacebuilders who can heal their communities through positive experiences.

To have laughter, compassion and peace.  I wish I could tell you ALL of our stories from the field that have happened over the last year but tonight I’d like to tell you about just one story of our growth starting from a single training.
