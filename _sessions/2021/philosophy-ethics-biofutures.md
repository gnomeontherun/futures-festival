Through the lens of ethics and philosophy, we will analyse collaboratively what the media imaginary raises on the topic of genetics, bio-enhancements and bio-futures. Our goal is to raise, together with the participants, new philosophical and ethical questions about the topic to fuel the discussion.
This is a collaborative session part of ongoing work from APF Ethics and Philosophy discussion group.
