The presentation will give participants a virtual tour through the Museum of Futures: Pandemic Pivots exhibition while recounting the process by which the exhibition was created. Future Festival participants will learn from our experience engaging diverse communities in participatory futures work, how we used artists as synthesisers of themes and imaginaries and how we constructed narratives that bridge current and hopeful discourses around climate change. Participants will also receive a link to the Virtual Museum which they can explore at their leisure.
