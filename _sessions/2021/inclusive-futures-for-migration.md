We, as forced immigrants, must start our life from scratch. We had to leave our country because our lives were at risk. Like me, thousands of people are skilled and have a unique talent left their country. The main question is what we could do about this issue and manage human resources effectively and efficiently. We must act responsibly and do something about them. We are potential human resources in the next ten years.
