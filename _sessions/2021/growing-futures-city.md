In 2020 ten diverse people gathered online to learn about futures thinking and strategic foresight, led and sponsored by Dr Cheryl Doig, Think Beyond. Using the Metafuture platform created by Sohail Inayatullah the team shared ideas, experienced futures in action and deepened their understanding. Four months later, the Ōtautahi Futures Collective was formed. Since then another cohort of 10 gathered f2f to grow the futures community of practice and city momentum is growing. During this presentation you will:

- hear the journey undertaken and lessons learned as we move from me to we
- grow an understanding of our metaphor, its indigenous roots and how diversity is valued and grown
- contribute to our next steps as a collective so we can continue to grow together
