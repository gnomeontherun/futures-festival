A real mixed bag of ethnicities, with native Brazilian, German, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish ancestry. A world citizen in love with the worlds cultures, creeds and peoples. I had to (re)construct my future many times, and as I write, my future is currently interrupted by a sudden job loss. Living my own version of the need to reconstruct personal futures.'

This session will be the international launch of Project Poli.Futuros, which allied to the UNESCO chair of Images of the Futures and Co-creation aim to use futures literacy tools to address the theme of futures in vulnerable communities, especially after the pandemics and co-create desirable and actionable futures together with these communities. The project is a Brazilian initiative that aims to use-the-futures as humanitarian tools for people to (re)connect to their purposes, (re)build agency and (re)claim sovereignty over interrupted or captive futures.
