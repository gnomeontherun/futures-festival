  bio: As a first-generation Haitian-American who has lived in Latin America, the
    UAE, China, and Southeast Asia, Sophia was moved to contribute to Black Futures
    research around experiences and perceptions of “blackness” in a global context.
    She is an independent foresight researcher and founder of FLYP (Futures Literate
    Youth and Professionals), a boutique coaching and consulting agency focused on
    “flipping the script” by promoting futures literacy and foresight capacities among
    systemically under-represented and marginalized groups. With a deep background
    in education, her work as a Purpose and Impact Coach is largely centered around
    advocating for and galvanizing a more conscious and conscientious youth.

title: Full Spectrum Blackness - Not a Monolith, Black Futures in a Post COVID Global
  Context
type: Keynote

The presentation will be about various workshops I've facilitated across different demographics of Black-identifying individuals across the globe (remotely).

These workshops will incorporate various tools and methodologies but the primary objective is providing a venue for an unintimidating introduction to futures literacy and facilitated discourse on a range of topics including: 

- Post-November 2020 US Election
- Education
- Career Development and the World of Work
- Travel and Movement
- Media and Marketing
- Spirituality
- Personal Futures

This is significant because it:

- raises awareness of futures/imagination literacy
- validates what many feel but perhaps haven't had a way to describe- being left out of the collective narrative
- provides them alternative ways of thinking for a greater sense of agency and empowerment
- presents an opportunity to hear from everyday people and amplify their voices in plain language through their experiences

Three ideas Futures Festival participants will learn are:

- Personal and collective narratives of Black-identifying individuals
- How Black individuals perceive viable and desirable futures
- The roles both Black and non-Black stakeholders can play in realizing those futures
