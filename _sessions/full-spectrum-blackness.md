title: Full Spectrum Blackness - Not a Monolith, Black Futures in a Post COVID Global Context
type: Keynote
---

The presentation will be about various workshops I've facilitated across different demographics of Black-identifying individuals across the globe (remotely).

These workshops will incorporate various tools and methodologies but the primary objective is providing a venue for an unintimidating introduction to futures literacy and facilitated discourse on a range of topics including: 

- Post-November 2020 US Election
- Education
- Career Development and the World of Work
- Travel and Movement
- Media and Marketing
- Spirituality
- Personal Futures

This is significant because it:

- raises awareness of futures/imagination literacy
- validates what many feel but perhaps haven't had a way to describe- being left out of the collective narrative
- provides them alternative ways of thinking for a greater sense of agency and empowerment
- presents an opportunity to hear from everyday people and amplify their voices in plain language through their experiences

Three ideas Futures Festival participants will learn are:

- Personal and collective narratives of Black-identifying individuals
- How Black individuals perceive viable and desirable futures
- The roles both Black and non-Black stakeholders can play in realizing those futures
