  bio: |-
    Roxi is an entrepreneurial design strategist and futurist from Toronto (currently based in Bermuda). She is fascinated by the ways digital trends of today will shape human experiences of tomorrow. From running discovery research to leading international roll-out of new innovations, Roxi loves the process of creating something from nothing.

    By day, you'll find her leading the experience design and product strategy at RBC. By night, you'll find her taking on passion projects alone or with her team of collaborators at 5Y Impact Collective. She is always eager to get her hands on (seemingly) unsolvable problems and uncertain futures.

* How harmful the content we consume and produce truly is on our perceptions of self and others 
* How virality algorithms alter what is shown and perceived as the norm 
* Who can change shape healthy content futures and how
