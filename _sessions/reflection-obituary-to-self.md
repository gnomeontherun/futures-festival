In this guided reflection session, Krittika Sharma will take you through an inward reflection on how -  Trying times stretch and test the human spirit. Trying times also bring us gifts. The gift of the pause. The gift to go inward. The gift to distinguish what is truly important. The gift to create meaning. In times like these, we must remember that we are not alone in this human experience. This gift is an invitation to explore our beautifully designed mortal spirit and unearth meaning.
