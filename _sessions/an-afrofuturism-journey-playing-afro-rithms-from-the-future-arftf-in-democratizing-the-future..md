Afro-Rithms From The Future game values:

1. Afro-Rithms From The Future is a forecasting game that suggests that by changing the traditional white, patriarchal normative gaze of racism and lens through which we normally view the world, we aim to change the game to expand alternative perceptions of the world through Black and (BIPOC) perspectives where Black and BIPOC futures are central and matter. 
2. The term Afro-Rithms is intentional to center the ubiquity of algorithms in our digital society to shift the digital lens that further reinforces and perpetuates dominant inequities to enable us to expand our range of possible and more equitable, liberating multiverses. 
3. We not only aim to democratize the future, we intentionally anticipate democratic Anti-Racist Futures where Black and BIPOC futures matter. 
4. A central question driving this game asks how do we democratize the Future with Afro-Queer AI as the starting point to create liberating, inclusive futures?
