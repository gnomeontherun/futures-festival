  bio: Wendy De Souza is a cis Latinx woman with Indigenous ancestry from Brazil,
    born and raised in Toronto Canada. She brings over 9+ years as an experienced
    public educator, prolific speaker and community mobilizer bringing conversations
    around equity, inclusion and women's liberation to the forefront. As a facilitator,
    feminist and workshop developer, her work is rooted in decolonizing spaces and
    practices by working from an intersectional feminist lens and an anti-colonial/anti-oppressive
    framework. In her intergenerational and cross-sectoral collaborations with the
    Toronto District School Board, Human Rights Legal Support Centre (HRLSC) and Canadian
    Alliance of Student Associations, she has been recognized for her extraordinary
    commitment to using arts-based practices to foster individual transformation and
    systems change. Through an interactive and dynamic approach, Wendy's energy inspires
    us to consciously co-create the communities around us through self transformation
    and liberation.
